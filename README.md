# What's in stock at Supreme?

Flask app that displays items that are currently in stock at Supreme's online store.


### Why?
There is currently no option on their website to sort through items based on availibility.


Twitter bot implementation of this app can be found [here](https://github.com/xalxnder/instock_or_not). 

#### FYI
Supreme's online store is currently closed, until the SS20 season, so this app, for the time being, cannot scrape their site for items. Luckily I saved some items in the "items.json" file the last time I ran the script.
